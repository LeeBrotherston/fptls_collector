# FPTLS Collector  <img src="https://travis-ci.org/LeeBrotherston/fptls_collector.svg?branch=master">

Based on <a href="https://github.com/LeeBrotherston/tls-fingerprinting">FingerPrinTLS</a> but acting as a "dumb" collector.  No fingerprint matching just data collection.  This will be used for centralised collection, analysis, and correlation by a FingerPrinTLS-a-like tool.
